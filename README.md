# Ponygames_Turnier
Should become a Joomla!-component that will help organising and administrate a competition in Mounted- or Pony-Games sport.

Pony- or Mounted Games is a sport not well known. So the szene is small and the work to organize a competition big. As a result
the quality often is at the lower end. This Joomla-Component should make it easier and make sure that all the work is done only 
once.

A championship of one year is a set of 6 competitions.
There are 
 - Competitions of the Swiss Championship of the Mounted Games Association Switzerland (https://mgaswitzerland.ch/)
   - a team is made up of 4 or 5 riders. 4 are active in a particular game.
   - Individual-Competitions: no teams but only single-riders.
 - Competitions of the Paires-Championship of Mounted Games Deutschschweiz (http://www.mounted-games-paires.ch/)
   - a team is made up of 2 riders (pair).
 - Other competitions without a national championship.
